## Architecture Highlights

### JSONB Hybrid Approach
All features use a hybrid database approach:
- **60-70% Evergreen Data**: Teams, events, matches (structured columns)
- **30-40% Season-Specific Data**: Game performance (JSONB columns)

**Benefits:**
- Season transitions require minimal changes
- Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces
- Flexible for game-specific data
- Efficient queries on stable data

### Service Layer Pattern
All features follow a consistent architecture:
- **Repositories**: Database access with validation
- **Services**: Business logic and orchestration
- **API Routes**: HTTP interface with error handling
- **Components**: UI with client-side validation

### Offline-First Design
Features support offline operation:
- IndexedDB for local storage
- Queue-based sync system
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Optimistic UI updates
