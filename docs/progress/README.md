# Progress Archive

Historical documentation of implementation phases and feature completions.

## Purpose

This directory contains **historical artifacts** documenting the evolution of the FRC Scouting System. These documents capture:
- Implementation summaries from completed phases
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Patterns and approaches used

**Note**: These documents are for **reference and posterity**, not active development. For current documentation, see [`/docs/features/`](../features/) and [`/docs/setup/`](../setup/).

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**JSONB Hybrid Approach**
- 60-70% stable schema, 30-40% flexible JSONB
- Enables season transitions without migrations
- Type-safe with TypeScript validation
- Performant queries on structured data

**Service Layer Pattern**
- Clean separation: Repository ‚Üí Service ‚Üí API ‚Üí UI
- Easy to test each layer independently
- Consistent error handling
- Reusable business logic

**Dynamic Form Rendering**
- Field definitions drive UI generation
- Non-developers can edit configurations
- Easy to add new field types
- Consistent validation across forms

### Challenges Encountered

**TypeScript Complexity**
- Generic types for season-specific data
- Type narrowing with discriminated unions
- Balancing type safety with flexibility

**Offline Sync**
- Conflict resolution strategies
- IndexedDB browser compatibility
- Testing offline scenarios
- Network edge cases

**The Blue Alliance API**
- Rate limiting (10 req/min)
- Data inconsistencies
- Missing match results before events
- Handling API downtime

## Contributing to Archive

When completing a major feature:

1. Write implementation summary document
2. Include:
   - What was built
   - Why (rationale)
   - How (architecture)
   - Challenges and solutions
   - Key learnings
3. Move to `/docs/progress/`
