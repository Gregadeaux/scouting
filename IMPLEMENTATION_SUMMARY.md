## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Authentication Fix (Critical)
**Problem**: Login succeeded but redirect failed due to cookie timing issue  
**Root Cause**: Client-side authentication couldn't persist cookies before middleware check  
**Solution**: Refactored to use Server Actions for 100% server-side authentication

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/auth/login/actions.ts` - Created server action for login
- `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - Refactored to call server action
- Result: **Login now works perfectly with proper session persistence**

### 2. Type System & Service Layer

**Created Files:**

#### `src/types/team-detail.ts`
```typescript
export interface TeamDetail {
  team: Team;
  event_key: string;
  pit_scouting?: PitScouting<RobotCapabilities2025, AutonomousCapabilities2025>;
  match_summary?: TeamMatchSummary;
  photos: TeamPhoto[];
  last_updated: string;
}
```

**Purpose**: Mentor-specific type definitions for team detail view

#### `src/lib/services/auth.service.ts` (Enhanced)
Added 4 permission helper functions:
- `canViewEvents()` - admin, mentor, scouter, viewer
- `canEditEvents()` - admin only
- `canViewTeamDetails()` - admin, mentor, viewer
- `canEditTeamData()` - admin, scouter

#### `src/lib/services/team.service.ts` (Enhanced)
Added `getTeamDetailForMentor()` method:
- Aggregates team data from multiple sources
- Extracts photos from pit scouting
- Calculates match summary statistics
- Returns unified TeamDetail object

### 3. API Routes

#### `src/app/api/events/[eventKey]/teams/[teamNumber]/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Fetch team detail data for mentor view
- **Auth**: Checks `canViewTeamDetails()` permission
- **Returns**: Complete TeamDetail object with all related data

### 4. UI Components (5 New Components)

#### `src/components/common/RoleBasedWrapper.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Conditional rendering based on user role
- **Usage**: Wrap admin controls to hide from mentors
- **Example**: 
  ```tsx
  <RoleBasedWrapper allowedRoles={['admin']}>
    <EditButton />
  </RoleBasedWrapper>
  ```

#### `src/components/mentor/TeamDetailCard.tsx`
- Displays team metadata (number, name, location, rookie year)
- Links to TBA and team website
- Clean, card-based design

#### `src/components/mentor/PitScoutingViewer.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Read-only display of 2025 Reefscape pit scouting data
- **Features**:
  - 6 collapsible sections (Drivetrain, Game Pieces, Scoring, Auto, Performance, Notes)
  - Formatted display of all robot capabilities
  - Handles missing data gracefully
- **Layout**: 2-column responsive grid for data fields

#### `src/components/mentor/MatchPerformanceSummary.tsx`
- Displays aggregated match statistics
- Color-coded reliability score (green >80%, yellow 60-80%, red <60%)
- Shows matches played, average points, win rate

#### `src/components/mentor/TeamPhotosGallery.tsx`
- Responsive photo grid (2-4 columns based on screen size)
- Click-to-enlarge modal using Dialog component
- Handles empty state with placeholder

### 5. Pages

#### `src/app/admin/events/[eventKey]/teams/[teamNumber]/page.tsx`
- **Type**: Server Component
- **Auth**: Checks `canViewTeamDetails()` before rendering
- **Data Fetching**: Uses TeamService to get complete team detail
- **Error Handling**: Shows 403 for unauthorized, 404 for team not found

**Key Fix**: Changed profile query from `.eq('user_id', user.id)` to `.eq('id', user.id)` (line 36)

#### `src/app/admin/events/[eventKey]/teams/[teamNumber]/TeamDetailClient.tsx`
- **Type**: Client Component
- **Layout**:
  - Full-width TeamDetailCard
  - Two-column: PitScoutingViewer (2/3) + MatchPerformanceSummary (1/3)
  - Full-width TeamPhotosGallery
- **Responsive**: Stacks on mobile, side-by-side on desktop

### 6. Integration Updates

**Modified Files:**
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Allow mentor access, change title to "Data Portal"
- `src/components/admin/Sidebar.tsx` - Show/hide menu items based on role
- `src/app/admin/events/page.tsx` - Wrap admin controls with RoleBasedWrapper
- `src/app/admin/events/[eventKey]/EventDetailClient.tsx` - Hide TBA import for mentors
- `src/components/admin/event-detail/EventTeamRoster.tsx` - Make team numbers clickable
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Add event cards for mentor dashboard

### 7. Configuration Fix

#### `next.config.ts`
Added Supabase hostname to `remotePatterns` to allow Next.js Image component to load robot photos:
```typescript
remotePatterns: [
  {
    protocol: 'https',
    hostname: '*.supabase.co',
    pathname: '/storage/v1/object/public/**',
  },
],
```

## 🎨 Design Patterns Used

1. **SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear purpose
   - Open/Closed: Service layer extensible without modification
   - Dependency Inversion: Services depend on abstractions

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - TeamRepository, ScoutingDataRepository for data access

3. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - TeamService orchestrates multiple repositories
   - Consolidation strategies for multi-scout data

4. **Component Composition**
   - Small, focused components
   - RoleBasedWrapper for cross-cutting permission checks

5. **Server Components + Client Components**
   - Server Components for data fetching and auth
   - Client Components for interactivity (collapsible sections, modals)
