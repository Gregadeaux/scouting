-- ============================================================================
-- FRC Scouting System - FIX RLS Policies (No table recreation)
-- ============================================================================
-- This script ONLY fixes the infinite recursion in RLS policies
-- Run this if you already have the tables created
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: Drop all existing RLS policies
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop user_profiles policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can create users" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update any profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Mentors can view team profiles" ON user_profiles;

-- Drop team_members policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own team memberships" ON team_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all team memberships" ON team_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Mentors can manage team memberships" ON team_members;

-- Drop match_scouting policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Scouters can submit match data" ON match_scouting;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view team scouting data" ON match_scouting;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Mentors can update scouting data" ON match_scouting;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete scouting data" ON match_scouting;

-- Drop pit_scouting policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can submit pit scouting" ON pit_scouting;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view team pit scouting" ON pit_scouting;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Mentors can update pit scouting" ON pit_scouting;

-- Drop teams policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view teams" ON teams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage teams" ON teams;

-- Drop events policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view events" ON events;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage events" ON events;

-- Drop match_schedule policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view match schedule" ON match_schedule;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage match schedule" ON match_schedule;

-- Drop team_statistics policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view team statistics" ON team_statistics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage statistics" ON team_statistics;

-- Drop audit_log policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view audit logs" ON audit_log;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can insert audit logs" ON audit_log;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 2: Create SECURITY DEFINER functions (to avoid RLS recursion)
-- ============================================================================

-- Get current user's role without triggering RLS
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_my_role()
RETURNS user_role AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN (
        SELECT role FROM public.user_profiles
        WHERE id = auth.uid()
        LIMIT 1
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public;

-- Check if current user is admin
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_admin(user_id UUID DEFAULT auth.uid())
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles
        WHERE id = user_id AND role = 'admin'
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public;

-- Check if current user is mentor for a team
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_team_mentor(user_id UUID, team_num INTEGER)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles up
        LEFT JOIN public.team_members tm ON tm.user_id = up.id
        WHERE up.id = user_id
        AND (
            (up.role = 'mentor' AND up.primary_team_number = team_num)
            OR (tm.team_number = team_num AND tm.team_role = 'mentor' AND tm.is_active = true)
        )
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public;

-- Check if current user can access team
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.can_access_team(user_id UUID, team_num INTEGER)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles up
        LEFT JOIN public.team_members tm ON tm.user_id = up.id
        WHERE up.id = user_id
        AND up.is_active = true
        AND (
            up.role = 'admin'
            OR up.primary_team_number = team_num
            OR (tm.team_number = team_num AND tm.is_active = true)
        )
